# README

This rails web application was designed to make managing skills in my DM's modern D&D Campaign much easier. The new system he designed is outlined below.


Characters no longer gain proficiency in skills. Instead, they gain skill points every level equal to the number of proficiencies they would normally have. For convenience, those numbers are:
	
	Barbarian - 2
	Bard - 3
	Cleric - 2
	Druid - 2
	Fighter - 2
	Monk - 2
	Paladin - 2
	Ranger - 3
	Rogue - 4
	Sorcerer - 2
	Warlock - 2
	Wizard - 2

	Artificer - 3
	Blood Hunter - 2
	Alchemist - 3
	Summoner - 2

## Expertise

Expertise grants a multiplier to your skill point of 1â…“. So, for every 3 skill points you put into a skill, you gain one extra rank in that skill. For example, if you have 9 skill points in a skill that has expertise, your effective skill rank is 12, before adding ability score modifiers. This makes the maximum possible skill rank 21 after ability score modifiers.

## Jack of all Trades

Jack of all Trades grants a +3 bonus to all skills in which you have used NO points.

## Background & Other Bonuses

Backgrounds that grant proficiencies in skills instead grant a bonus of +3 to those skills. This DOES count towards the maximum number of points in those skills, but if it exceeds your skill rank maximum, it is not reduced. You simply cannot put any more points into that skill until your skill point maximum increases high enough to allow it (+4 or higher in most cases). Bonus proficiencies granted by class or racial features act in the same way.

## Other Proficiencies

Tool, weapon, armor, and language proficiencies granted at character creation function as normal. Additionally, a player may spend 4 skill points to gain one of these proficiencies during downtime, or when they gain a level in any class.
